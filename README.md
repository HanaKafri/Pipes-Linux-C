# Pipes-Linux-C
I made a system using C language in Linux, with a simple opengl window.
It is a competition between the children processes that the parent process creates which are divided into 2 teams, each child process choose a random number in the range that the parent chose, and the team with a larger sum that the last child finds wins. 
In this system, pipes were used to exchange the data between children and parent processes.
To run the system, use linux shell, and run the file run.le. don't forget to give a premission for the file befor running it.
