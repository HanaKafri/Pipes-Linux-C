# Pipes-Linux-C
I made a system using C language in Linux, with a simple opengl window.
It is a competition between the children processes that the parent process creates which are divided into 2 teams, each child process choose a random number in the range that the parent chose, and the team with a larger sum that the last child finds wins. 
In this system, pipes were used to exchange the data between children and parent processes.
